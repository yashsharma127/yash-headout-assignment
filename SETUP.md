# Setup Guide: Java Application Deployment with Containerization, ELB, and CI/CD

## Prerequisites

- Machine has ssh agent running connected to github for ssh cloning.
- AWS account with admin or sufficient IAM permissions
- [Install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
- [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Java 17 runtime (`java -version`)

## 1. Repository Setup and Script Usage

- Fill in the `.env` file with:

    ```
    REPO_SSH_URI=git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git
    REPO_DIR=/path/to/clone
    JAR_PATH=build/lib/project.jar
    ```

- Make script executable:
    ```
    cd ./script
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```

- Run the setup script:
    ```
    sudo ./setup.sh
    ```
- Expected: Clones repo, checks for tools, starts the application.

---

## 2. Containerization with Docker

- Build the Docker image:
    ```
    cd ./docker
    docker build -t myapp:latest .
    ```
- Run the container:
    ```
    docker run -p 9000:9000 myapp:latest
    ```
- Visit `http://localhost:9000/` to check output.

---

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

- Configure repository secrets in GitHub:
    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`.
    - `ECR_REGISTRY`, `ECR_REPO`.
    - `EC2_HOST`, `EC2_USER`, `EC2_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- Copy pipeline workflow `./github/workflows/deploy.yml` to the java project repo.
- copy `dockerfile` to the root of java project repo
- Push to `main` branch to trigger pipeline.
- Monitor Actions tab for job progress.
- After build, image is pushed to AWS ECR, and EC2 is updated via SSH.

---

## 4. Infrastructure with Terraform (ELB)

- Edit `terraform.tfvars` with real values:

    ```
    vpc_id = "vpc-xxxxxxxx"
    public_subnets = ["subnet-aaaabbbb", "subnet-ccccdddd"]
    ec2_target_ids = ["i-xxxxxxxx"]
    alb_security_group_ingress_cidr = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    ```
- Note: remember you are logged into awscli for using this terraform script

- Initialize and deploy:
    ```
    cd ./Terraform_ELB
    terraform init
    terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
    ```

- After apply, copy the output ALB DNS name, and test app at  
  `http://<alb_dns_name>/`

---

## 5. Security Group Association

- **Important:** In the AWS console, add the ALB security group (created by Terraform) to the EC2 instanceâ€™s inbound rules for port 9000, or adjust your EC2's security group to allow inbound from the ALB SG only.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- Review application logs.
- Check Target Health in AWS > EC2 > Target Groups if you get 502 or 5xx errors.
- Confirm port mappings and open firewall/security groups.

---

## 7. Cleanup

- To remove infrastructure:
    ```
    cd ./Terraform_ELB
    terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars
    ```
- To stop Docker containers:
    ```
    docker stop <container_id>
    ```
